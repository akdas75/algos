When using char s[] = "hello";, the char array is created in the scope of the current function, 
                                hence the memory is allocated on the stack when entering the function.

When using char *s = "hello";, s is a pointer to a constant string which the compiler saves in a 
      block of memory of the program which is blocked for write-access, hence the segmentation fault.
